# üòÅ More about me

<div align="justify">

Hi! Here's a little more about me. For this, feel free to click on each session available below!

<details title="My academic background" align='left'>
<br>
<summary align='left'>üìö My academic background</summary>

I have a computer technician from Escola T√©cnica Vital Brasil (2013) where I became familiar with notions of hardware, robotics, HTML/CSS, Pascal, Delphi, C, Java, SQL and VisualBasic. I've also become a self-taught x86 Assembly developer ever since. During high school with technical training, I worked as a computer instructor for all ages, with the federal government program Telecentros.BR (Brazil).

Later I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences from the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG), with an emphasis on Biotechnology and Health, focusing on the areas of Bioinformatics, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

<details title="My trajectory" align='left'>
<br>
<summary align='left'>:hourglass_flowing_sand: My trajectory</summary>

My life as a developer started at age 2, when I was introduced to a computer. Later, at age 15, I decided to take a technical course in computer science, which made me fall in love with programming. In this course I learned some languages and learned the basis to seek to learn others on my own.

Also at that time, operating systems aroused a great interest in me. I started using Ubuntu as my main operating system and soon became interested in trying to develop one from scratch. In 2012, I started to develop an operating system based on `Linux from Scratch` tutorials, called Netuno SO. I learned a lot about organizing an operating system, maintaining and operating a Unix-like system, creating and maintaining makefiles and compiling packages, which allowed me to gain a lot of experience in administering a Linux system. This project also ignited my passion for Unix systems even more, which led me to research, study and try to develop an operating system on my own, focusing on a Unix-like model. I started to create projects derived from free operating systems, to learn more about how they work and start my own project.

I'm a loyal open source user and all my projects have been released with some free license (mostly BSD). I am passionate about the design and implementation of operating systems, as well as their administration. I created and maintain a simple and free operating system, for educational purposes, which can be found in my [projects](PROJECTS.en.md). This operating system project stems from my fascination with Unix systems and a desire to better understand how an operating system works and is organized. This project is open to new ideas and collaborations!

<div align="justify">

* :computer: x86 Assembly is my favorite language and I practice a lot in my free time.
* :dna: I am a biologist with experience in molecular biology.
* :orange_book: I'm very interested in the history of computing, especially the history of UNIX and derivatives.
* :dvd: I have a virtual collection of operating systems (installation media).
* :night_with_stars: I am fascinated with Unix-like systems and have used at least once almost every system known to man. I really enjoy researching more about the history and organization and trying to implement the model in Hexagonix (my personal project).
