I am the creator and, so far, the sole developer of Hexagonix, an operating system developed entirely from scratch in x86 Assembly that takes a lot of inspiration from Unix systems, even if I don't have any of these codes. The biggest inspiration for development was to create a system similar to FreeBSD and Linux, while allowing me to learn more about how an operating system works and about hardware. In the last seven years of development, I have made some advances with Hexagonix, such as developing a stable kernel with graphics, disk and FAT16B file system support, as well as porting the flat assembler to run on top of Hexagonix, making it self-hosting. I also developed an IDE that allows the development of applications on top of Hexagonix and for Hexagonix. Now, the complete system code, including the kernel, utilities and APIs, has been released as free software under a BSD license, allowing interested parties to participate in this project and expand it or just to study more about the organization of an operating system, Assembly or hardware.

The project is maintained in separate repositories under a unique user. You can find the repositories and get more information about the project [here](https://github.com/hexagonix/).

## 2️⃣ Lunix OS - work in progress (2022-present)

[Lunix](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/Lunix) is a new operating system developed in C for the x86 architecture. It is in an early (very early) stage of development.

## 3️⃣ GaiaBSD - work in progress (2022-present)

GaiaBSD is a fork of FreeBSD aimed at studying more about Unix systems and trying to develop a more user-friendly distribution based on the robustness of FreeBSD.

## 4️⃣ PX-DOS - not active (2013-2015)

[PX-DOS](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/PX-DOS) is derived from an older version of a DOS system, the [Public Domain Operating System](http://www.pdos.org/) (PDOS). PX-DOS adds new layers, abstractions and functions on top of PDOS and extends its functionality. Also added a number of new utilities (userland) to the base system.

## 5️⃣ Everest OS - not active (2015-2016)

[Everest OS](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/EverestOS) is a fork of a free and public domain operating system (Snowdrop OS), found [here](http://sebastianmihai.com/snowdrop), to study 16-bit operating systems while developing Hexagonix (32-bit).

### Bin Operating System (Bin S.O) - not active (2013)

[Bin S.O](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/Bin-S.O) i my first attempt to develop an operating system (2013) using x86 Assembly.

# Tools and utilities

## 1️⃣ Java Power Shell (JPS) - not active (2013)

[Java Power Shell (JPS)](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/Java-Power-Shell) is a portable shell developed in Java and tested on Linux, macOS and Windows.

## 2️⃣ PX BASIC (PXBAS) - not active (2013-2014)

[PXBAS](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/PXBAS) is a simple BASIC interpreter for MS-DOS, FreeDOS, PX-DOS, PDOS and compatibles. May work in 32-bits versions of Windows.

# Platforms

## 1️⃣ Arduino - Arduino-based projects - not active (2012-2018)

You can found my explorations on Arduino [here](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/Arduino-stuff) and [here](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/AxiomKernel).
