# Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felipenlunkes/felipenlunkes/master/wave.gif" width="30px" height="30px" />

## About me üíÅ 

Hi! My name is Felipe Lunkes (he/him) and I am a brazilian developer and biologist. 

My life as a developer starts at the age of 2, when I was introduced to a computer. Later, at the age of 15, I decided to take a technical course in computing and programming, which made me fall in love with programming. In this course I learned some languages and also tried to learn others by myself, in a self-taught way. Today, I have experience in C, x86 Assembly, Java, Pascal, Basic, Visual Basic (.NET) and Python.

I am a loyal open source user and all my projects were released with some free license. I have a passion for designing and implementing operating systems and I created and maintain one as a hobby, as you can see below in my active projects. This operating system project of mine stems from my fascination with Unix systems and a desire to better understand how an operating system works and is organized.

I am currently studying JavaScript, Java and Python with the aim of becoming a backend and frontend developer. I am also a biologist with an interest in developing solutions for bioinformatics.

I am in career transition and looking for an opportunity as a developer.

## üíé My active projects  

üìç I am currently working on these personal projects:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Hexagonix/Andromeda Operating System (Hexagonix OS)

<p align='center'>
<a href="https://github.com/hexagonix"><img height="150" src="https://github.com/hexagonix/Doc/blob/main/Img/Hexagonix.png"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

I am the creator and, so far, the sole developer of Hexagonix, an operating system developed entirely from scratch in x86 Assembly that takes a lot of inspiration from Unix systems, even if I don't have any of these codes. The biggest inspiration for development was to create a system similar to FreeBSD and Linux, while allowing me to learn more about how an operating system works and about hardware. In the last seven years of development, I have made some advances with Hexagonix, such as developing a stable kernel with graphics, disk and FAT16B file system support, as well as porting the flat assembler to run on top of Hexagonix, making it self-hosting. I also developed an IDE that allows the development of applications on top of Hexagonix and for Hexagonix. Now, the complete system code, including the kernel, utilities and APIs, has been released as free software under a BSD license, allowing interested parties to participate in this project and expand it or just to study more about the organization of an operating system, Assembly or hardware.

The project is maintained in separate repositories under a unique user. You can find the repositories and get more information about the project [here](https://github.com/hexagonix/).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ GaiaBSD

<p align='center'>
<a href="https://github.com/felipenlunkes/GaiaBSD"><img height="150" src="https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/blob/develop/icons/freebsd.svg"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

GaiaBSD is a fork of FreeBSD aimed at studying more about Unix systems and trying to develop a more user-friendly distribution based on the robustness of FreeBSD.

## Other completed projects

### Operating system design and implementation

* [Bin S.O](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/Bin-S.O) - My first attempt to develop an operating system (2013) using x86 Assembly.
* [Everest OS](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/EverestOS) - A fork of a free and public domain operating system (Snowdrop OS), found [here](http://sebastianmihai.com/snowdrop), to study 16-bit operating systems while developing Hexagonix (32-bit).
* [PX-DOS](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/PX-DOS) - PX-DOS is derived from an older version of a DOS system, the [Public Domain Operating System](http://www.pdos.org/) (PDOS). PX-DOS adds new layers, abstractions and functions on top of PDOS and extends its functionality. Also added a number of new utilities (userland) to the base system.

### Tools and utilities

* [Java Power Shell (JPS)](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/Java-Power-Shell) - A portable shell developed in Java and tested on Linux, macOS and Windows.
* [PXBAS](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/PXBAS) - A BASIC interpreter for MS-DOS, FreeDOS, PX-DOS, PDOS and compatibles.
* Arduino - Arduino-based projects [here](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/Arduino-stuff) and [here](https://github.com/felipenlunkes/AxiomKernel).
